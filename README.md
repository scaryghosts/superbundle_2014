Super Bundle 2014
=================

Super Bundle is a charity raffle by The University of Pittsburgh to benefit the 
[United Way](www.unitedway.org).  Known as the greatest collection of items ever 
collected, Super Bundle 2014 exceeds several years of previous bundles.  How?  Well, Super Bundle 2014 
is not just a bundle, it's three bundles!  These bundles include such wondertastic items as a 
waddle of penguins, a Sony Playstation 4 with games (a bundle within the bundle), two copies of 
Dragon Ball GT, an Android tablet, an Apple ][e, Hello Kitty Fizzy Pop, and more.

Super Bundle is a joint effort by several individuals of CSSD's Network Operations Center.

The Web site utilizes the following free software:

* [Apache httpd](https://httpd.apache.org/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) and its [Bottle](http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html) module
* [MongoDB[(http://www.mongodb.org/)
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)

Put that together with a handful of sysadmins and netadmins pretending to be Web 
developers and out comes the Web site in this repository.

<h2><a name="sbtss"></a> Q: How can my friend get a ticket?</h2>
<h3> A: You are being awfully vague there, so I'll assume your "friend" doesn't work for ECIT. That's fine, we have the Super Bundle Ticket Sharing Sytem (SBTSS). This program invites you to purchase tickets on behalf of your "friend". You will recieve an email with all of your ticket numbers. Simply reserve all or a portion of those numbers for your "friend". When the winning ticket is chosen, even though your name is attached to the winning number, you will know in your heart that your "friend" has actually won. Please be gracious and give all the prizes to their true owner, your "friend". </h3>
